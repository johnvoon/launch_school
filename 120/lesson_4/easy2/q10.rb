Benefits to using OOP

Creating objects allows programmers to think more abstractly about code
Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize
Allows us to only expose functionality to parts of code that need it
Namespace issues are much harder to come across
Allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication
We can build apps faster as we can reuse pre-written code
Can more easily manage software complexity
